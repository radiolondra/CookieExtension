# CookieExtension

Browser extension built in C# (Blazor) and Javascript

### How to Test

To test, clone this repo and install it as <u>unpacked extension</u> from the `browserextension`folder.



### Description

In this extension were used:
[Blazor.BrowserExtension](https://github.com/mingyaulee/Blazor.BrowserExtension): interface to create extensions in Blazor
[WebExtensions.Net](https://github.com/mingyaulee/WebExtensions.Net): A package for consuming WebExtensions API in a browser extension.
[BlazorStrap](https://blazorstrap.io): Bootstrap 5 components for Blazor

The functionality of this extension was implemented mainly to show "how to do things." Therefore, code study is necessary and sufficient, besides, of course, basic knowledge of C#, Javascript, Blazor and the libraries used.
